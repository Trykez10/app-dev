### Likes — Details
- **Science + Emotion**: The big scientific concepts are framed through family — that’s what makes it hit emotionally.
- **Visuals**: Planet designs and the black hole are cinematic and memorable.
- **Soundtrack**: Zimmer’s organ-based themes are haunting and perfect for space.
- **Cooper & Murph**: Their arc is a clear emotional throughline.
- **Real physics**: The team consulted physicists; it avoids cheap sci-fi nonsense.

### Dislikes — Details
- **Pacing**: Some viewers may find the middle slow — long takes, slow reveals.
- **Confusing science**: Without patience or a guide, some equations / terms feel dense.
- **Sound mixing**: A few scenes drop the dialogue volume under effects.
- **Ending**: The emotional resolution may feel forced to those who want strict realism.
- **Side characters**: Secondary players are mainly functional to the plot.
